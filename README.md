# Student-Grade-Generator

## Intoduction

In this challenge one is required to come up with a function that will prompt the user to input student marks and the input to be between 0 and 100. 


## Challenge-Context. 
The challenge is to come up with a function that will prompt the user to input student marks. 
The first this is to declare a function and give it a name:

    function gradeGenerator(){
        //code block to be executed
    }

Our function in this case will not be taking any parameters. In the next part we are going to write the code block that will be executed when we call our function. In this code block, we will declare a variable and assign it a value and this value will prompt the user to input student mark which inturn make the grade to be logged. We will use the window prompt() method.

After the declaration we use the if and else if statements to write our range of marks that when the condition inside the if or else if statements is true it will be executed. The grades and rangrs of marks to be input are:

    A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

Ensure that you write the correct range so that when you input your marks in the prompt it will give the right grade.

## Conclusion
The function I wrote is functioning. When I call it I get a propmt asking for the input of marks and it gives the grade.



# Speed-Detector

## Introduction
In this toy problem one is required to write a program that takes the speed of a car. The program should print some statement when certain conditions are met.

## Challenge-Context
This challenge requires one to take the speed of car as input. If the speed of the car less that 70, the program should print "Ok". However for every 5 km/s above 70, the program should give one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points. If the points exceed 12 points, the program should print "Licence suspended".

The first thing to do is to declare a function and give it a name. This function too will not take any parameters. In this case our function is :
       
       function calculateSpeed(){
        //code block to be executed
       }

Within the code block, we are going to use the if and else if statements. The first if statement is going to have the condition of speed being less that 70 and if its true the program will print "Ok". The next will be an else statement. In this statement the code block will be counting demerit points for each distance travelled above 70. After getting the points, you use a nested if statement with a condition that when the points are greater that 12 the program prints "Licence Suspended". There is also an else if statement with a code block that the program will print the demerit points if they are less than 12.

## Conclusion
After doing all that, my program is ready and functioning very well.
